# Arch Package Manager (APM)
These are the 'upgraded' versions of PAUR combining all of it's functions plus some other utilities like blacklists, package restoration*, storage info and a few others. Each version corresponds to a particular stage that the script is in as I add features to it; i.e v1.1 is stage 1, v1.2 is stage two and so on and so forth.

Now, in as much as I test and use each version and addition in the script myself I cannot guarantee that it'll work as intended 100% of the time so do monitor the operations it does when running the script.
 
Any instructions on how to use it will soon be in the wiki but even if I don't publish it, you can still figure it out pretty easily without guidance.

As stated before, all the scripts are AI generated so there may be a few errors and inconsistences across different versions as I add, remove and refine different parts of the script. This is why I've also shared each and every version and iteration of the script so in the event that one of the scripts breaks you can just use a previous version.
