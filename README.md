# Arch Package Manager (APM)
This is the 'upgraded' version of PAUR combining all of it's functions plus some other utilities like blacklists, package restoration*, storage info and a few others.

Any instructions on how to use it will soon be in the wiki but even if I don't publish it, you can still figure it out pretty easily without guidance.

As stated before, all the scripts are AI generated so there may be a few errors and inconsistences across different versions as I add, remove and refine different parts of the script.
